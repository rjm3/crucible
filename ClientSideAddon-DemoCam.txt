Notes
=============
This is meant to be used for the Recording (so you can create scripted videos)
As this isn't meant for playing in a server, the functions haven't been tested for stability.
The plugin itself isn't unstable, just the function calls haven't been tested

Functions
=============
DemoCamSpecial::createObject()
	- Creates the camera object, $dcs_obj is set by this

DC::GetPosition ()
	- x z y - Limited this to just democam's created with the createObject

DC::SetPosition(x, z, y)
	- Yes, they are seperate parameters

DC::GetFullRotation()
	- x z y
	- Tribes apparently stores the camera position without clipping it to -PI to PI...this will show you numbers above that

DC::GetRotation()
	- x z y
	- Clips to -2PI and 2PI...

DC::SetRotation(x, z, y)
	- Yes, they are seperate parameters

DC::moveToPosition("x z y", %time, [Optional: callback])
	- Moves the camera to the position in %time seconds
	- Put a callback function for when the movement is complete (so you can string together multiple movements)
	- e.g. DC::moveToPosition("0 0 0", 10, "myPosDone");

DC::turnToRotation("x z y", %time, [Optional: callback])
	- Same as move, but with rotation
	- Fun fact, z is roll...so you can do a barrel roll

DC::moveCubicWaypoints(%tribesVariableArray, [Optional: callbackFunction]);
	Using CubicHermiteSpline
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "0 0 0 5"; //After 5 seconds go from point 0 0 0, then 10 0 0 in 3 seconds, 0 0 10 in 2 seconds, 0 10 0 in 1 second (11 seconds total camera time)
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "10 0 0 8";"
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "0 0 10 10";"
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "0 10 0 11";"
	DC::moveCubicWaypoints('waypointB');

DC::turnCubicWaypoints(%tribesVariableArray, [Optional: callbackFunction]);
	Using CubicHermiteSpline
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "0 0 0 5"; //After 5 seconds go from point 0 0 0, then 10 0 0 in 3 seconds, 0 0 10 in 2 seconds, 0 10 0 in 1 second (11 seconds total camera time)
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "10 0 0 8";"
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "0 0 10 10";"
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "0 10 0 11";"
	DC::turnCubicWaypoints('waypointB');


DC::navigateCubicWaypoints(%tribesPosVariableArray, %tribesRotVariableArray, [Optional: callbackFunction]);
	- Does both both rotation and position at once (synchronized)
	Using CubicHermiteSpline
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "0 0 0 5"; //After 5 seconds go from point 0 0 0, then 10 0 0 in 3 seconds, 0 0 10 in 2 seconds, 0 10 0 in 1 second (11 seconds total camera time)
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "10 0 0 8";"
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "0 0 10 10";"
	e.g. $waypointB[0] = "0 10 0 11";"
	e.g. $waypointBr[0] = "0 0 0 5";
	e.g. $waypointBr[0] = "10 0 0 8";"
	e.g. $waypointBr[0] = "0 0 10 10";"
	e.g. $waypointBr[0] = "0 10 0 11";"
	DC::navigateCubicWaypoints('waypointB', 'waypointBr');
