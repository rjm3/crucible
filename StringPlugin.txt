Functions
=============
Parameters in [] are optional

String::timestamp()
Time::Epoch()

String::len(%str) (about 10 times faster)
String::getsubstr(%str,%begin,%len) (fixed the %len limit that came with tribes) (string::newgetsubstr is now pointless)
String::replace(%str,%old,%new) (5 - 10 times faster, 50x faster if your using the old tribe script functions)
String::replaceAll(%str,%old,%new)

String::right(%str, %amt) //Gets %amt of the rightmost characters abcde, 3 = cde
String::left(%str, %amt) //Gets left most characters
String::rpad(%str, %pad) //Pads %pad on the righthand side *doesn't crop it to length*
String::lpad(%str, %pad) //Pads on left

String::clipTrailing(%str, [%alpha]) (String::clipTrailing(%str, "1234567890") == clipTrailingNumbers(%str))
	%alpha is a list of characters that will be clipped from the end
	if %alpha does not exist (String::clipTrailing(%str) it assumes 0-9, but is optimized)


String::CopyUntil(%str, %find) Copies until it finds %find as a value/str...does not include %find in copy (case senstive)

String::getWord(%str, %seperator, %word);
	examples used to test this
	echo(String::getWord("show",",", 0));
	echo(String::getWord("showthis,wohs",",", 0));
	echo(String::getWord("dontshow,wohs",",", 1));
	echo(String::getWord(",,,,,wer,sdfert,,,,,,wertysdgf,aedfrgtrt",",", 3));
	echo(String::getWord("wer,sdfasf,,",",", 2));
	echo(String::getWord("show,asdf,asdf, wer",", ", 0));
	echo(String::getWord("show,asdf,asdf, wer",", ", 1));
	echo(String::getWord("show,asdf,asdf, wer",", ", 2));
	echo(String::getWord(", , , , show,asdf,asdf, wer",", ", 0));
	echo(String::getWord(", , , , show,asdf,asdf, wer",", ", 1));
	echo(String::getWord("show,asdf,asdf, , , , , , , , , wer, , , , , , , , , , , , , ",", ", 1));
	echo(String::getWord("show,asdf,asdf, wer, , , , , , , , , , , , , ",", ", 2));

String::LCS(%str1, %str2, [%ignoreCase]);

getWordCount(%str, [%sep]) //%sep must be only 1 character long, but is optional (space is considered the default if %sep is not given)

String::offset(%str, %offset); (500x faster than a Tribes implementation, this offset text by a certain amount)
String::ReverseHexTranslation(%str); (Should revert mostly back to readable text...not recommended for server side stuff)

String::Char(%str, %num); (Returns the character at the position %num [%num 0 - length-1]) returns "" if %num exceed length

String::CharN(%str, %num); (Returns the number value of the character at the position %num [%num 0 - length-1]) returns -1 on error

String::RemoveWords(%str, %words); (Returns %str with the %words removed, truncates multiple spaces and leaves an extra space at the end)
	This should be roughly 100x faster than a tribes script

String::Shuffle(%str); (Returns a string of the shuffled words)

Word::FindWord(%str, %find, [%sep])
	This will return the word # (eg. word::findword("zero one two", one) = 1)
	%sep is optional, if it is not included a space will be used.  %sep must have length 1
	*Fixed, as previous version didn't bother to account for additional characters (Reported by Phantom)

Word::getSubWord(%str, %begWordIndex, %length, [%sep])
	This will return the string starting from %begWordIndex and continue for %length (much like string::getsubstr except with words)
	%sep is optional, if it is not included a space will be used.  %sep must have length 1

File::OpenFile(%path, %append) (restricted to temp,recordings,config, base/missions)
	If you use this you must call CloseFile or else the file will be locked up.  You can only open one file at a time.
File::OFExportString(%string)
	File must be open, this makes things just a bit quicker
File::CloseFile()
	Call this every time you open a file

File::ExportString(%path, %string, %append) (restricted to temp,recordings,config, base/missions)
File::Import(path, variableArray, [limit]) (restricted to temp,recordings,config, base/missions)
e.g. File::Import("temp\\text.txt", "readVar"); will read text.txt file and put each line into
	the $readVar...to get a certain line just use $readVar[3]
[limit] is the most lines to read
I suggest clearing the variable you choose before reading in, but $variableArray::count will equal how many lines were read in

getIntRunTime();
getRunTime();

Vars
============
$[variableArray]::count from File::Import, the lines read in
