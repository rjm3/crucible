Plugin in early stages *Should work, but not quite fully tested*

This overrides the export's string script.  It should be noted that this is still slightly experimental, and you should rather use the File:: functions to write your data if possible
No guarentees that this will work...but my testing would appear to have it working correctly *10000 random write test*

Variables
=============
//This also fixes the export problem (you can safely export 3000+ characters, but this is still slightly experimental,
	so make sure you make backups before using this plugin...the experimental part would be the exporting fix...it needs to escape string...I think I wrote it right, but only time will tell)
$Pref::TerrainCollision = true; //Set to true to enable all types of detections (terrain, dis, dts...etc with players), false will revert to standard (must restart to change)
