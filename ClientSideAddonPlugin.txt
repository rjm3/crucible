Notes
=============
Using this to expand functionality to the clients.

If you are just recieving the dll file (not part of a distribution package) please add the following to the pluginloader.cs file

$PluginLoader::ClientSideAddonPlugin = true;

Functions
=============
remoteCSA::CheckFeatures();
	When called, this will send a list of features to the server (specifically remoteCSA::ClientFeatures(%client, %feature))
remoteClient::setOverlayColor(%client, [r 0 - 1], [g], [b], [alpha 0 - 0.76]);
	e.g. Server-side use remoteeval(%client, "client::setOverlayColor, 0, 1, 0, 1); //Sets green at the max it can (internally it gets forced to 0.76)
	e.g. Water effect remoteeval(%client, "client::setOverlayColor", 0, 0, 1, 0.5);
	This remains between server! (But not restarts thankfully)
		remoteClient::setOverlayColor(2048, 0, 0, 0, 0); //Add this on main lobby mode and you should be okay...or just restart

remoteClient::JoinMessages(%client, true);
	e.g. Hides the join messages

skyDML(%dmlName);

stretchSky(%number);

rotateSky(%number);

Variables
=============
$Pref::disableColorOverlay = false; //Enable or disable color overlays.  False by default


Server Code
=============
function remoteCSA::ClientFeatures(%client, %feature)
{
	$CSA::Features[%feature] = true;
}

//Add this part somewhere when client loads
remoteeval(%client, "CSA::CheckFeatures");


OpenGL Information
==================
Windowed mode - This is hacked in.  FullScreen OpenGL should maintain it's original code, but hacked in a few calls to allow for Windowed screen
	This is experimental.  There may be a few crashes that need to be fixed (but it's better than Software mode I think)
