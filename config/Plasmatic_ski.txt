 Jump/ Jet/ Ski script by Plasmatic
 http://www.annihilation.info/plasmatic

 Script taps jump repeatedly when the spacebar is held down. Jumps whenever Jetting to get additional height -the same as tapping space bar when first jetting. Includes a weapon changer for scroll mice (change weapons with the scroll button) that may or may not work for you.

 Compatable with everything or stand alone. Your choice.

 Lazy install: Unzip directly into your:
C:\Dynamix\TRIBES\config directory. This will overwrite any existing autoexec.cs (not present in fresh installs).

 Or: Drop Plasmatic_Ski.cs into Tribes\config and add:
exec(Plasmatic_Ski); 
to Tribes\config\autoexec.cs (open with notepad). If you don't have an autoexec.cs, follow the install instructions above.

 Advanced: You may also copy the code directly from Plasmatic_Ski.cs or this file, and add it directly to autoexec.cs



 Enjoy.

 ? This script checks for a mounted weapon before jumping on jetting to fudge around accidently jumping out of vehicles while flying. If you're a passenger, you'll jump off if you jet. You've been warned.

 ?? If you have problems, while in Tribes hit ~ to bring up the console, and type: exec(autoexec); The console should respond with "Executing Plasmatic_Ski.cs." If it doesn't, make sure the file: Plasmatic_Ski.cs exists in your config directory, and the line:
exec(Plasmatic_Ski); is in your autoexec.cs. Advanced installers get lost.. ;)

The complete code is below if you're lazy like me...
