Notes
=============
Using this to expand functionality to the server.  (The client can have a standard 1.11 and still join!)

If you are just recieving the dll file (not part of a distribution package) please add the following to the pluginloader.cs file

$PluginLoader::ServerSidePlugin = true;

Functions
=============
CollisionCallback::Mask(maskNumber)
	Used to detect the collision of a player with an object
	CollisionBallback::Mask("2147524708"); //This is the default
	See the collision mask at the bottom of the this text document to see what masks to use

Player::setJet(%aiId, true/false)
	On AI death make sure to set it to false (otherwise the next AI that spawns with this ID will be flying)

Player::getPitch(%client)
	Get's the pitch of the client

Player::setPitch(client, value [ -(88 * PI / 180) to (88 * PI / 180) ]);
	Set's the pitch of the client

Player::setGravity(client, gravity)
	Sets a players gravity (a note, gravity gets calculated but not sent to the client...so they might experience a slight jutter)

Player::getGravity(client)
	Gets a players gravity

Client::setSkin(%cl, %skin)
	Modified this, it doesn't do as many checks on the client, so it will allow you to setAI skin

ShowAICrash(true/false)
	Used to show whether a crash scenario was detected and prevented
