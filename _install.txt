Just extract this to your tribes.exe directory and it should run

Your tribes directory should look something like this

console.cs //You should already have this one
tribes.exe //You should already have this one
mem.dll 	//Important that you use this mem.dll included in the zip
Plugins\	//Folder
Plugins\..	//A fair amount of files, but if you extracted and the plugin folder exists it should be good
