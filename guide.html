rj has provided his own form of starter guide on the primary Crucible website on the right-hand side here:
rpgcrucible.org<p>

As it says in the title, this thread is heavily, heavily work-in-progress because CRU is not only very complex but also very much in development. I'm working on this guide in my free time, so it's possible that specifics may no longer be accurate if it's been a while since this thread has received an edit. In general, everything is subject to change.

Welcome to Crucible RPG!<br> 

For those of you familiar with Tribes RPG, be warned that Crucible is radically different from every other TRPG variant to date and only superficially resembles traditional TRPG. 
<p>
For those of you new to Tribes RPG in general, be warned of the above in case you choose to hop over to the other two extant TRPG servers: Chrono and Phantom. Also note that CRU in some respects rivals modern RPGs for complexity – as a result, there is very much a learning curve in CRU. Fret not! That's what this guide is for.
<p>
In either case, CRU draws heavily from Anarchy Online, Path of Exile, Diablo, and other games for many of its mechanics and systems. We'll get into what that means in practice in later sections of the guide. Some of those mechanics and systems are fairly complicated, so walls of text may follow.
<p>
For now, buckle up, enjoy the read, and welcome to the Crucible.

See below for info on these.<p>

If you've stumbled upon this thread and have no idea what in the blue hell I'm talking about, Crucible RPG is a total conversion of a total conversion mod for the original Starsiege: Tribes. First released in 2001, Tribes RPG has seen many, many different variations rise and fall across a great variety of servers over the years. At present, three servers currently exist: Phantom Worlds, Chrono RPG, and Crucible RPG. Phantom Worlds is the second longest-running TRPG server in existence and still sees active development and distribution. Crucible RPG is still heavily in-dev as of this writing (November 2015) and in a semi-closed beta phase. 
<p>
Starsiege: Tribes and its sequel Tribes 2 were made freeware in May 2004 in celebration of the then-upcoming release of Tribes: Vengeance. As a result, both of the downloads above include Starsiege: Tribes.
<p>
(Link 1) If you're interested in playing Crucible RPG, then you'll need to download the Crucible RPG client at the first link above. You'll need the "Complete Download" plus the latest "Beta Update". This installation also includes everything you need to play on Phantom Worlds and Chrono RPG but may be missing some client-side features specific to Phantom Worlds. 
<p>
(Link 2) Everything you need to play TRPG on Phantom Worlds and Chrono RPG can be found at the second link above. Download the latest repack (full or minimal, doesn't matter – full simply contains files for a variety of other non-RPG client-side mods that have existed throughout the years) and you're good to go.
<p>
Once you've installed and run your new client, you'll be prompted to enter a name for a new character. Your name cannot contain anything but the 26 letters of the alphabet. In a field on the left you'll see "Other Info" ("RPG Password" in Phantom Worlds client). This is how each of these servers ensures that your characters are yours – choose something you'll remember and don't give it out to anyone. The passwords are case sensitive. 
<p>
Be advised that if you join a non-RPG server, that field will be visible in plaintext to everyone else in that server (In base Tribes, it's normally a field used for filling out your player profile when people select you in the TAB menu). 
<p>

<font size="4" color="lime"><u>Races, Classes, and Progression -- [RCNP]</u></font><p>

When you log on to the CRU server for the first time, you'll immediately be prompted to choose a race. This choice is a pretty big deal for how your character is going to play out, but never fear – if you want to try something different, just create a new character in the Tribes client and reconnect to create a new character. There are no limits on how many alts you can have on this server. 
<p>
Remember to type "#defaulttalk #g" into chat to send your messages server-wide!
<p>
Your choices are these:
<p>
Human :: Medium STR, Medium DEX, Medium INT<br>
100 HP, 100 Mana<br>
Middle of the road and does a solid job at everything but excels at nothing. This is probably your best bet for a first character until you're familiar with CRU's systems. 
<p>
Elf :: Low STR, Medium DEX, High INT<br>
70 HP, 130 Mana<br>
Classic caster-focused race. High intelligence also makes them good for magic crafting.
<p>

Dark Elf :: Low STR, High DEX, Medium INT<br>
80 HP, 120 Mana<br>
The typical rogue-oriented race. High DEX makes them great thieves, archers, and stealthy backstabbers while the INT makes spending SP on spell skills fairly painless.
<p>
Orc :: High STR, Medium DEX, Low INT<br>
130 HP, 70 Mana<br>
The Schwarzeneggers of CRU. Well-suited for bashing skulls and taking a beating.<p> 

Shadow Orc :: Medium STR, High DEX, Low INT<br>
120 HP, 80 Mana<br>
A unique STR / INT hybrid that works well for evasion / critical / physical defense characters.<p>

The "low / medium / high" dictates not the flat amount of these attributes that you start with but rather the multiplier for the SP invested. "Low" means x0.8 and "high" means x1.2. For example, an Orc with "high" STR will have 120 effective STR for 100 SP invested. Note that you are not required to raise three or even two attributes – you can get by with raising only your primary attribute, but each item modifier in the game has an attribute associated with it and will require that attribute to equip (with the exception of weapons).
<p>
As you might imagine from looking at their basic attribute breakdown, each race is generally better suited to one classic RPG "archetype" than the others. That said, if you wanted to play a classic tanky warrior sword-and-board character, you could choose Elf and make it work. Don't be afraid to experiment, as that's what CRU is all about.
<p>
Once you've chosen your race, you'll be spawned just outside Keldrin Encampment. This is home base – the Tristram of CRU's first world. 
<p>


<font size="4" color="lime"><u>Skill Points -- [SCPP]</u></font><p>

As soon as you spawn, hit tab, then 3 to access your skills menu. You start with 80 SP and gain another 80 SP every time you level. Do not try to max everything – you won't get anywhere close. Figure out what it is you want to do. Let's assume you want the tanky sword-and-board warrior I mentioned earlier. That means you want to prioritize your SP expenditures on Strength, Endurance, Weapon Handling, a weapon skill (Slashing and especially Bludgeoning are good choices for a tank), and probably Primal Magic. 
<p>
Other skills will be important for your character besides these core investments. Literacy is required to benefit from the Master quests (head to the Quests section for more info). Weight Capacity affects not how much loot you can carry but the weight capacity of your armor (more on this later). Energy (mana pool is based on this) might not seem important to a non-caster, but you'll need some of it to cast your buffs from whatever magic school you choose. Wisdom and the Memory stat that it affects is discussed in the Spells section below.
<p>
Required XP to level goes up every time. The math is Current Level * 1000, so a level 50 character requires 50,000 XP to level.
<p>

<font size="4" color="lime"><u>Perks and Passives -- [PRKS]</u></font><p>

You'll begin with 1 passive point and gain 1 passive point every level after that. Passive points are spent to gain passive bonuses to a wide variety of things including physical damage with specific weapon types, lifesteal, reduced mana usage for spells, and so on. If you explore the perks list and select one, you'll get a breakdown of the passive's benefits. 
<p>

Be warned that passive respec points are currently very hard to come by, so spend carefully.
<p>

- "Regular Mods" are mods that you get a portion of based on the number of points invested. "Archer" gives 40% increased archery weapon damage.  The max number of points per passive varies, but most are 20 like Archer. That means this passive gives 2% increased archery weapon damage per point spent.<br>
- "Max level" mods are benefits given once the perk is maxed out – for Archer, that's an additonal 10% archery weapon damage at 20 point investment.<br>
- "Level-based" mods are mods that you benefit from based on your character level. The math for what you'd get per point is ((Total Benefit / Your Level) / 20).<p>

Perks are where your character's specialization is really going to come into force. A tank would want shield block perks; a rogue focusing on DoT damage via poison would want poison damage perks and so on. Consider banking your first 10 – 15 perk points while you decide where you want your character to go. Note that passives based on specific damage types should probably be avoided – you can't be guaranteed to have a weapon that will deal that damagetype and you may not always want to cast damaging spells of that damagetype.
<p>


<font size="4" color="lime"><u>Basic In-game Commands and the Tab Menu -- [CMND]</u></font><p>

<font size="4" color="lime"><u>1. Chat Commands -- [CCMD]</u></font><p>


All Tribes RPG variants make use of the chat window (default "T" in Crucible, default "P" in Tribes Repack) to cast spells, look up items, and the like. Such commands are always prefixed with a pound sign "#". After spawning, you'll immediately want to type "#defaulttalk #g" in chat to set your default chat channel to the whole server. These commands work in both Phantom Worlds and Crucible unless otherwise noted. Other important commands include:
<p>
#set
:: This is a very important one. If you hit "0" (zero), you'll get a list of keys that can be used with this command. You can use #set to cast spells (e.g.: "#set f #cast fireball") or activate skill-based attacks and abilities ("#set 1 #hide"; "#set b #cleave"). The commands listed below can be used with #set unless otherwise noted.
<p>
#meditate (default M): Start meditating when out of combat. Heal and mana potions are more effective in this state.<br>
#wake (default N): Stop meditating.<p>

#cast SPELLNAME – Casts the named spell on you or your target.<br> 
#fav – Accesses your favorite spells list. Clicking a spell on this menu will immediately cast the spell.<br>
#addfav – Adds the indicated spell (e.g.: "#addfav martialstudies4") to your favorites list for easy casting.<br> 
#rfav – Removes the indicated spell (e.g.: "#rfav martialstudies4") from your favorites list.<p>

#hide – Hiding and Piercing-specific skill. Hide from enemies and players. Checked against Perception, which is only found on gear and buffs. If you attack from this state, you will be performing a sneak attack for 3x damage if the attack lands.*<br>
#brawl – A generic extra attack for melee weapons. The attack is at its most powerful and has the shortest cooldown when used with Martial Arts weapons. Has a 10% chance to stun the target and a very high chance to hit. <br>
#cleave – Slashing-related, based on Cleave skill. Your next attack will deal 1.5x damage and might cause bleeding if it lands.<br>
#aim – Archery-related, based on Aiming skill. Your next attack will deal 1.5x damage and almost always hit. Contrary to its name, this attack does not currently have a higher chance to hit than a normal attack.<br>
#bash – Bludgeoning-specific skill. Your next attack will deal 1.5x damage and have a chance to stun if it lands.<p>

The following commands are not yet #set compatible:<p>

#w ITEMNAME - This is the item and spell lookup function. In Crucible, this formatting can be strange. To look up the spell "Ninja I", for example, you will need to type "#w ninja1". The number in this case corresponds to the level of the spell. You can also #w skills ("#w Dark Magic") to get info on a skill's attribute distribution (more on this in the skills section).<br>
#up – Updates your passive modifiers. This happens automatically when changing zones, but do it if you invest passive points and don't plan on changing zones any time soon.<br>
#merchants – Displays the time til the next merchant stock refresh and randomization.<br>
#recall – If you happen to fall through the map or otherwise get stuck, this is the command to use. If you're falling and get a Z-velocity check failure, keep trying.<br>
#sellall – BE VERY CAREFUL with this. When you're standing near a merchant, this will sell everything in your backpack that isn't on your No Sale list (light blue; see Tab Menu section below).<br>
#salvageall – BE VERY CAREFUL with this. This will salvage everything in your backpack that isn't on your No Sale list (light blue; see Tab Menu section below). The resulting materials are used in crafting and smithing.
<p>

<font size="4" color="lime"><u>2. The Tab Menu -- [TBMD]</u></font><p>

The TAB menu is where everything that doesn't involve bashing (or melting or piercing or slashing or...) skulls is done. Below is a picture of the TAB menu's front page:
<p>
Most of these are self-explanatory, but a few nuances of control may not be:
<p>
Your equipped items menu can be accessed with "G" by default. You can't yet directly swap items from your backpack and your equipped item slots, so you'll need to go here to unequip the item that you're replacing. 
<p>
Your Backpack (access directly with "I") contains all of your unequipped items, loot, potions, etc. Items that are colored light blue are on your No Sale list and cannot be sold or salvaged with #sellall and #salvageall respectively. The can still be stored at the bank and remain on your no sale list until you remove them. You can have a maximum of 25 items on your No Sale list. Access this list by typing #nosale, which will allow you to remove items from the list.
<p>
Crafting is done with the crafting table. If you want to combine two items – say, a Knife and an Altering Relic to randomize the Knife's stats – then you'd select the Knife in the backpack, hit "Add to craft", do the same for the Altering Relic, and then "Complete" the craft on the crafting table. Crafting with salvaged materials is done with the Smithing / Crafting menu and selecting the item. Once you hit a specific item type such as "Piercing" under "Weapon", the craft will immediately begin and consume the required materials!. 
<p>
When navigating the SPELLS menu, it's generally easiest to use the "#w" command for a spell name (remember the format: "#w spellstrike1", "#w spellstrike2", and so on up the tiers) than to navigate to each one and hit "Info".<p>

<font size="4" color="lime"><u>Item Randomization -- [ITMR]</u></font><p>

Point(s) of reference: Diablo, Path of Exile<p>

tl;dr: Items are randomized more or less just like Diablo. Items can be modified with "relics" analogous to Path of Exile's "orbs" by using the crafting table.
<p>

A (as far as I know) comprehensive list of item mods can be found here:<br>
http://rpgcrucible.org/skills_mods.html<p>

CRU utilizes a full item randomization system like what you'll find in classic ARPGs. Every item in the game can roll different rarities including Common, Fine, Magic, Rare, Legendary, Unique. The first five rarities dictate the number of possible mods that an item can roll – higher rarity, more mods. Unique items always have the same mods, but might vary in the exact amount of each mod. Item mods are as varied as you can imagine – more attack speed, more damage, resistance to specific magic schools, bonus against certain types of enemies, flat damage increases, sockets (into which you place runes), and so on. 
<p>
An additional layer of complexity is "Quality Level". Due to limitations of Tribes' engine, only a certain number of base item types can exist, but QL allows CRU to expand any given basetype to fit any level. Items can drop or be crafted with QL ranging from 1 to 300. Higher QL means better stats, higher level requirement, and higher stat requirement, as well as the potential range of the randomized modifiers listed above. QL does not necessarily dictate when you can use an item based on its stat requirements. In the next section I'll talk about the idea of "twinking" and how you can equip items that allow you to punch above your weight.
<p>

<font size="4" color="lime"><u>Quality Level and Crafting -- [QCLR]</u></font><p>


You'll probably find at least one "Altering Relic" early on. Relics are a class of items that can be used to modify any other item – Path of Exile veterans will recognize relics as "orbs". An Altering Relic will randomize up to three mods on an item, removing the old ones and replacing them with new ones. To use a relic, select it in your inventory, hit "Add to Craft", do the same for the target item, and then complete the craft. 
<p>
Quality Level (or QL) is what determines how high a given item's base stats and requirements are, as well as how high its flat modifiers can roll. Percentage-based modifiers aren't affected by QL. QL ranges from 1 (newbie gear) to 300 (endgame). Generally speaking, you want to use items at as high a QL as you can, but if items have some juicy mods at a lower QL, go for it. Weapons are where QL tends to be the most important, as that affects their base damage stats which percentage damage modifiers will work off of. 
<p>
QL is very important for completing certain item combines. 
<p>
You'll often find runes – Mind Rune of Necromancing, for example. These can be placed into items with sockets – the combination will consume the socket and replace it with the mod listed on the rune. The rune and item must be within 80% QL of eachother. For example, you need at least a QL80 rune to add a rune to a QL100 item. 
<p>
For Smithing, which results in armors, non-magic weapons, and the like, your Smithing skill will determine the highest possible QL item that you are able to craft. Smithing uses Smithing Materials which are gained by salvaging items. At present, you will always craft at the highest QL that you are able to with your skill. A way to display what that max QL is and specify what QL you want if it's lower than that (probably with something like #setql NUMBER) is in the works.
<p>
Edit from rjm3: #setql was added 
<p>
Magic Crafting results in usable spellcrystals, wands, staves, magic shields, and so on. The same rules for Smithing apply. Crafting Materials are gained by salvaging items. Magic Crafting's biggest draw is combining Empty Spellcrystals and Spellbooks. Add a crystal and add a spellbook to your crafting table and complete it to get a usable crystal. The spellbook and spellcrystal must be within 80% QL of one another. Spellcrystal QL is seen in the [brackets] that follow the name; spellbook QL can be found by looking at its info.
<p>
Crafting and Smithing materials are received when salvaging items. Select the item in your backpack and then salvage it. Items must be QL8 to have a chance to grant materials, and at least QL16 for guaranteed materials. You can #salvageall to salvage everything in your backpack that is salvageable. Everything, except items on your No Sale list. Spellcrystals and item runes cannot be salvaged. 
<p>

<font size="4" color="lime"><u>Tiers, Integrity, and Rarity -- [TRRS]</u></font><p>

Tiers add an additional layer of complexity to item randomization. We'll use two-handed Slashing weapons as an example: 
<p>
Giant Sword<br>
Flamberge<br>
Crystal Sword<br>
War Sword<br>
Great Sword<p>

Each of these weapons is cosmetically different, has a 3 second swing speed, and requires the Slashing skill. That list is "worst" to "best" ordered from top to bottom. Each step up the tier increases the rolls of any given mod by 5%, as well as the potential implicit roll and its base damage stats. A Giant Sword might roll a 100% increased damage explicit mod, but a Great Sword with the same roll would receive 120% increased damage for being four tiers higher (5% each tier). Generally speaking, low-tier items are trash but the top one to three (or even five depending on big the range is) are potentially worth keeping and crafting.
<p>
Integrity is a value that ranges from 0% to 30% on an item. 1% integrity equates to 1% increase on all of an item's mods, both explicit and implicit. Some items drop with integrity, but you might want to raise the integrity of an item yourself by using an appropriate item:
<p>
Sharpening Stone: All weapons except staves and wands<br>
Magic Stone: Staves and wands<br>
Piece of Cloth: Resist-based / INT gear<br>
Armour Scrap: Armor-based / STR gear<br>
Spool of Thread: Evasion-based / DEX gear<p>

Rarity is yet another impactor of the rolls on item modifiers. As with basetype tiers, each step up in rarity increases all explicit and implicit rolls on an item by 5%. Items may drop at any of these rarities or they may be forced to a higher rarity with a relic – see the next section for more details on relics.
<p>
Common* -> Fine -> Magic -> Rare -> Legendary<p>

* - A completely basic item with no explicit modifiers<p>

<font size="4" color="lime"><u>Relics and Item Modification -- [RLLC]</u></font><p>

You'll likely find at least one Altering Relic early on in your Cru gameplay. This is the most common type of relic, a set of items that modify gear. 
<p>
Altering Relic – Randomizes three properties on a Common item, turning it into a Fine item. Can also be used on Fine items to randomize their modifiers again.<br>
Regal Relic – Turns a Fine item into a Magic item, adding a modifier and increasing all rolls by 5%. <br>
Cosmic Relic – Turns a Magic item into a Rare item, adding a modifier and increasing all rolls by 5%.<br>
Heroic Relic – Turns a Rare item into a Legendary item, adding a modifier and increasing all rolls by 5%.<p>

Regret Relic (NYE) – Resets one passive point or completely resets the SP investment of the specified skill.<br>
Blessed Relic – Rerolls the implicit modifier of an item (e.g.: the base Evasion roll on Evasion armor). <br>
Divine Relic – Rerolls the numbers of modifiers that already exist on an item. <br>
Chaos Relic – Randomizes the modifiers of a Rare item. <br>
Mystic Relic – Randomizes the modifiers of a Magic item. <br>
Rune Prism – Allows you to replace a specific modifier with a socket. <p>

All relics except Altering relics are quite uncommon, so use them wisely. Refer to the section above on tiers and rarities to get a better idea of when it's worth using these relics. 
<p>

<font size="4" color="lime"><u>The Skill System and Twinking -- [SKNT]</u></font><p>

Point(s) of reference: Anarchy Online<p>

tl;dr: You get 80 SP and 1 passive point every level. Spend them wisely, as resets are very hard to come by right now. You need to meet an item's skill requirement to equip it, but not to keep it equipped.
<p>
Access your skills by hitting tab, then 3, then a category. You'll see two numbers: the left number represents your SP investment and the right number represents your effective skill. Using a theoretical character that's raising Slashing as an example: 
<p>
(50) Slashing [175]
<p>
I've invested 50 SP, but I have effectively 175 Slashing skill. Thus, any item requirement for 175 Slashing or less is met. If you equip an item that grants a numeric bonus to your Slashing skill, then that bonus will be added to the effective skill. This ties directly into the "twinking" system of CRU: you can temporarily buff skills and equip items you normally wouldn't be able to equip, remove the items that are buffing that skill, and the item will remain equipped. 
<p>
As an example, if I equip an item that gives me a +25 Slashing skill bonus, I'll have 200 effective Slashing. I equip a Slashing weapon requiring 190 skill, remove the item with the +25 bonus, and although my Slashing skill is only 175, the item remains equipped and usable. This opens up a wide array of possibilities for what you can equip and cast by juggling different items and buffs. Indeed, many spells increase certain skills temporarily (typically for an hour). Bonuses from those buffs can be used the same as item bonuses for twinking.
<p>
Also note that every ability is tied to one or more basic attributes (strength, dexterity, intelligence). This means that investing into the basic attributes that support a skill will also raise that skill at a certain ratio – this is called "trickle". These extra points affect the effective skill level and aren't affected by other caps to SP investment. This is a great way to squeeze out just a few more points for a skill when you're capped for the level or out of SP (as gear and buffs with improve basic attributes will trigger trickle). Slashing is 100% supported by STR. 10 points of STR will equal one extra point of Slashing in this case. To find out what attribute(s) affects a given skill, type "#w SKILLNAME" without any spaces. 
<p>


<font size="4" color="lime"><u>Spells, Buffs, and Memory -- [BSNM]</u></font><p>

Point(s) of reference: Anarchy Online, MMOs in general<p>

Spells work somewhat differently in CRU: You don't start out "knowing" all spells and needing just the required skill. Upon creating a new character, hit Tab and go to your inventory: you'll see Crystal: Fireball and Crystal: Ironfist. These are "spell crystals" that you use in order to add a spell to your spellbook. Select and examine them (or use #w on the spell name) for info on the specific spell. Also check out the "Spells" section of the tab menu for a list of all spells in the game.
<p>
Buffs are spells that you or someone else has cast on you. Like most RPGs, buffs improve stats and/or skills temporarily. In CRU, most buffs are between 45 minutes and 1 hour long. 
<p>
"Memory" is what gates buff stacking. If you hit Tab, 1, and 1, you'll see a stat called "Memory" listed as "0 / 10" by default. This represents your capacity for holding buffs. Every spell that provides a buff requires memory – for example, Ninja I (#w ninja1) takes up 10 memory and will therefore be the only buff you can have running on you at that time. The "Wisdom" skill increases memory at a rough ratio of 10 skill per 1 memory capacity.
<p>
Wisdom also permits you to wear belts and memory stones. Belts are items that have no tiering or rarity but instead offer a substantial implicit bonus based on their QL as well as a minimum of three slots for memory stones. Memory stones increase your maximum memory baesd on their QL, and thus are a good way to open up more memory for buffs without having to invest heavily into Wisdom. Some examples of belts and their modifiers include but are not limited to:

I mentioned things like Crystal: Fireball earlier. This is again how you learn spells in CRU. Hit the magic vendor in Keldrin Encampment. You'll notice that she's selling a mixture of spellbooks, empty spellcrystals, and complete spellcrystals (such as Crystal: Fireball). In the world, a spell may drop as either a spellbook or a crystal. A spell must be turned into complete spellcrystal form before it can be learned. The spellbook + empty spellcrystal craft requires a mixture of Literacy and Magic Crafting in fairly high numbers. Unless you're investing SP into those two skills (ill-advised unless you're creating a tradeskill-specific character), you're going to have to rely on complete spellcrystals either dropping or being sold by the magic vendor.

This is currently the only quest line in CRU.<br>

To the left of the cellar entrance is a house wherein you will find Delina, who wants you to enter the cellars and retrieve a Goblin head. 
<br>


Upon returning to her at level 5 with goblin head in hand, she'll reward you with a weapon of your choice and a Mossy Tome. Hang on to this tome! At level 10, you'll want to visit one of three masters: Rogue, Mage, or Warrior. 
<p>

The Warrior master's outpost, directly Northwest of town.<p>

The Rogue master's ruins, East-Southeast of town.<p>


The Mage master's tower. Follow the road South out of Keldrin Encampment. At the first fork, take a right.<p>

Each of these masters will offer you a choice: offensive or defensive. Your choice will determine what tome you get. These tomes offer a large array of powerful buffs that reinforce the archetype of the master you've chosen. As an example, the offense Warrior master tome gives you a good deal of physical damage, armor penetration, Primal magic, and the like. This first tome is not the only tome you're going to get -    the masters give you rewards every ten levels, with upgraded tomes coming at 30, 50, 80, and 100. The interim 10s offer a rare weapon or passive points. 
<p>
You may return to Delina with another goblin head to get the "The Tomes" quest again and choose another tome from another master – or the tome that you didn't get from your first master the first time around.
<p>
These same masters in their respective structures are also present in the smaller, higher-level Desert world. See the next section for more info on moving to the Desert world.

#travel<p>

As of this writing, Crucible RPG consists of 3 worlds on 3 separate but linked servers. <p>

The world that you begin on is the Forest world. The second world is the Desert world. The other two are WIP and will be the Jungle and Snow worlds. Each world is built for a specific level range: 
<p>
Forest :: 1 - 100<br>
Desert :: 100 - 200<br>
Jungle :: 200+ (speculative)<p>

You will stop receiving XP at the level "cap" for each world, though you can still level higher elsewhere and return to a lower world.<p>

For the purposes of the beta, the #travel command is how you'll travel between the worlds. At the proper launch, you'll be required to complete a quest for a key that will grant you access to the portals leading to each world.
